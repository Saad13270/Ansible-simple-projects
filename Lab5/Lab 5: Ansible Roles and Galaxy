LAB5:  Create a role for setting up a database server and  Utilize an Ansible Galaxy role for web server setup.


Certainly! In this scenario, we'll create an Ansible role for setting up a database server, and then we'll utilize an Ansible Galaxy role for setting up a web server. This assumes that you want to set up a database server and a web server on separate machines.

TASK1:

Create an Ansible Role for Database Server Playbook:
---
- name: Install Database Server
  hosts: database_server
  become: yes

  vars:  # Define variables here
	db_server_package: "mysql-server"  # Replace with the appropriate package name

  tasks:
	- name: Update package cache and install the database server package
  	apt:
    	name: "{{ db_server_package }}"
    	state: latest


Execute the playbook : 
Ansible-playbook myplaybook.yml

Step2: .Utilize an Ansible Galaxy Role for Web Server Setup:
ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.nginx

5.Create an Ansible Playbook:

---
- name: Setup Nginx Web Server
  hosts: web_server  # Replace with your target hosts or group
  become: yes

  roles:
	- geerlingguy.nginx




Execute the Ansible Playbook:

ansible-playbook  your_playbook.yml
